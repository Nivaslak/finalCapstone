# Age and Spending Score Analysis

This file contains Python code that demonstrates the relationship between age and spending score using linear regression analysis. The code utilizes the `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` libraries to load the data, plot a scatter plot, fit a linear regression model, and visualize the best fit line.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

python
Copy code

## Usage

1. Ensure that the dataset file `Mall_Customers.csv` is in the same directory as the script.
2. Import the required libraries at the beginning of your Python script:
3. Plot a scatter plot of age vs. spending score
4. Fit a linear regression model to the data
5. Make predictions on the input data
6. Plot the best fit line:
7. Show the plot:
