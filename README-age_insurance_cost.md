# Linear Regression Analysis

This repository contains Python code that demonstrates the use of linear regression to analyze a dataset using the pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn libraries.
The purpose of this analysis is to understand the relationship between age and insurance charges.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Ensure that the dataset file 'insurance.csv' is in the same directory as the script
2. Import the required libraries at the beginning of your Python script
3.Load the data from the 'insurance.csv' file
4.Plot a scatter plot of the data
5.Fit a linear regression model to the data
6.Plot the best fit line on the same graph as the scatter plot
7.Run the script and observe the scatter plot with the best fit line
